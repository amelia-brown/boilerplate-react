## Boilerplate React Setup

This is a example setup for a react/redux project using babel and webpack.

1. `npm init -y` Initialize npm package, create package.json file and
   .gitignore with node_modules and bundle.js
2. Install dependancies
  * `npm install react react-dom redux react-redux --save`
3. Install dev dependancies
  * `npm install babel-core babel-loader webpack babel-preset-react babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-stage-0 --save-dev`
4. Add build script to package.json
5. Create .babelrc file in root directory
    * the .babelrc is a JSON file containing a presets array with
      es2015, react and stage-0 as items.
6. Create src/ and lib/ directories in the root of the project
    * create an index.js file in src with a root component
    * the src/ directory will be the entry point of the app
    * the lib/ directory will contain the bundle.js output from webpack
7. Create webpack.config.js in root directory
    * in the config object, define a key called entry. This is where
      webpack will look for the scripts to compile
    * output is the file containing the scripts compiled by webpack. The
      file is called bundle.js and is generated by webpack.
    * module contains the loaders that will transfrom the file
8. Run `npm run build` to make sure the webpack build runs correctly
    * you should see a build hash, what was built and how long it took
    * now there is a bundle.js file in the directory specified in the
      output in webpack.config.js
